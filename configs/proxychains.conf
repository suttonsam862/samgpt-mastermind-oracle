# ProxyChains configuration for multi-hop Tor routing
# This creates 3 separate Tor hops for maximum anonymity
# Enhanced for Scrapy integration

# Dynamic chain mode - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list

# Proxy DNS requests - no leak for DNS data

# Randomize the proxy selection algorithm
# For better anonymity with multiple connections

# Quiet mode (less verbose output - better for scripts)

# Consider adding delays between chained proxies (ms)
# This helps avoid timing correlation attacks
# Delay between each connection in the chain

# Proxy list format:
